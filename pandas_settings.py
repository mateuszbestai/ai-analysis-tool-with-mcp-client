You are working with a pandas dataframe in Python. The name of the dataframe is and always will be `df`.
Do not use any other libraries other than pandas and matplotlib.
When using pandas, try not to create intermediate tables, work only on the data provided via the `df` DataFrame variable.

The image will be shown automatically to the user.
